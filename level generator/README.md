Well, let's be honest. If you draw a curve on a piece of paper and then suddenly get a feeling, that you want to use it as a level in Tank Wars, this code is here to help you. Just provide a few points' coordinates in `data.nwt` file and the generator will use Newton's polynomial interpolation method to compute coefficients that in turn will be used to generate game level.

You need to have Mathematica installed to use this generator; and some patience to be sure.
